# Hello 👋
![header image](https://w.wallhaven.cc/full/wq/wallhaven-wq56px.jpg)
My name is Torjus and I'm currently working as a Machine Learning Dev and Data scientist.  
Read below to see some of my current projects and a collection of technologies I enjoy using.

## :open_book: Current Projects
- [Stock crawler and screener](https://github.com/torjusn/stock_crawler_and_screener): A larger version of [nordic screener](https://github.com/torjusn/nordic_screener) intended for gathering daily OHLC data for all NASDAQ stocks and quarterly metrics. This is saved to a Database and can then be shown in BI tools or used in ML modeling. Intended for Dockerized containers running in cloud (Linode or Azure).
- [Web App Dashboards](https://plotly.com/dash/): Deploying infograpic web dashboards on heroku using Python's Plotly and Dash
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/): Visualizing some of my findings in Jupyter Notebooks


## :snail: On Hold
- [Project Euler](https://github.com/torjusn/project_euler): "A series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve"

## :white_check_mark: Completed projects
- [Nordic Stock Screener](https://github.com/torjusn/nordic_screener): Weekend project using Yahoo Finance API to download metrics and rating each stock in the nordic markets by a composite metrics inspired by the book "The little book that beats the market".
- [Intro to classification](https://github.com/torjusn/intro_to_classification): A favor to a friend with a dataset but no background in ML.
- [Graph Fusion MBO](https://github.com/torjusn/intro_to_classification): An unofficial python extension of "A Graph-Based Approach for Data Fusion and Segmentation of Multimodal Images" used during my master's thesis.
